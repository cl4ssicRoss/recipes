      <h2>new way to make a really good venezuelan pasticho!</h2>
      <p>If you've ever had the classic Italian lasagna, let me tell you that there's a very similar version in this Latin country called pasticho, which is also similar to the Greek pastitsio. The first two are made with pasta sheets and the latter with macaroni, but they're all a real treat.

        Venezuelan pasticho is one of the most popular and traditional dishes in the South American nation. If you ask a local family what they're eating for Sunday dinner, they'll likely say pasticho, pabell√≥n criollo, or a good sancocho.</p>

        <h3>now lets go!</h3>
        <p>
            Here are the steps to make a Venezuelan pasticho:
            
            Ingredients:
            
            1 pound lasagna sheets
            1 pound ground beef
            1 onion, chopped
            2 cloves garlic, minced
            1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
            1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
            1 (15-ounce) can tomato paste
            1 teaspoon dried oregano
            1 teaspoon dried basil
            1/2 teaspoon salt
            1/4 teaspoon black pepper
            1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese
            1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
            1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
            Instructions:
            
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            Cook lasagna sheets according to package directions.
            In a large skillet, brown ground beef over medium heat. Drain off any excess grease.
            Add onion and garlic to the skillet and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.
            In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, spinach, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
            To assemble the pasticho, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna sheets. Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of tomato sauce mixture. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan cheese.
            Bake for 30 minutes, or until heated through and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
            Tips:
            
            For a more flavorful pasticho, use a combination of ground beef and ground pork.
            Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the tomato sauce mixture for a bit of heat.
            Sprinkle the top of the pasticho with chopped fresh parsley before serving.
            Enjoy!</p>
