    <h2>follow these steps</h2>
    <p>Ingredients:

        1 pound (450g) spaghetti
        4 large egg yolks
        1 whole egg
        1/2 cup (120g) grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus extra for serving
        Freshly ground black pepper
        4 slices pancetta, finely chopped (or guanciale, bacon as substitutes)
        1 tablespoon olive oil
        1 garlic clove, minced (optional)
        Instructions:
        
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package directions until al dente (slightly firm to the bite). Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.
        
        While the pasta cooks, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and Pecorino Romano cheese in a large bowl. Season generously with black pepper.
        
        In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta (or substitute), and cook until crisp and golden brown. If using garlic, add it in the last minute of cooking until fragrant.
        
        Remove the pancetta from the heat and set aside.
        
        Once the pasta is cooked, transfer it immediately to the bowl with the egg mixture. Toss well to coat the pasta with the egg and cheese mixture.
        
        Return the empty pasta pot to low heat. Gradually add some of the reserved pasta water (a tablespoon at a time) to the pasta and egg mixture, whisking constantly, until a creamy sauce forms. Don't overheat the mixture, as the eggs can scramble.
        
        Stir in the cooked pancetta (or substitute). Season with additional black pepper to taste.
        
        Serve immediately, with extra Pecorino Romano cheese for sprinkling on top if desired.
        
        Tips:
        
        Don't pre-cook the pancetta in advance, as it can dry out.
        Use warm pasta water when adding it to the egg mixture, as it helps temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling.
        For a richer sauce, use all egg yolks or add a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese to the egg mixture.
        Feel free to adjust the amount of cheese and black pepper to your liking.
        Garnish with fresh parsley for an extra pop of color and flavor.
        Enjoy your delicious pasta carbonara!</p>
